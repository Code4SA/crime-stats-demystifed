# Re-mapping crime statistics

Every year SA police reports the numbers of the 47 types of classified crimes as
recorded at the police stations over the course of the previous year. However debatable the accuracy of the numbers, it remains the main official source of the crime data in SA.
The data can be explored at the Crime and Justice Hub of the Institute for Security Studies
(ISS) site:
https://www.issafrica.org/crimehub/map/

Due to the fact that the geographical boundaries of the police districts and the official census areas
are not aligned, the number of crimes at various geographical level, e.g. municipality or neighborhood, has remained obscure.

ISS estimated the levels of municipal crime based on the total number of
corresponding crime incidents recorded for each police station precinct
with more than 50% overlap with a municipality of interest:
 https://www.issafrica.org/crimehub/municipal/

We asked a question of whether the ISS calculations could be improved,
and more importantly, whether we could design a way of estimating the number of crimes at
a more granular level, e.g. a city or even suburb.
As it turned out, inferring crime statistics at a desired level is very much possible
with a bit of maths and some coding.

How have we approached the question? In brief, we took the geographical boundaries of the police districts, for which the crime data is available, and the census boundaries with the population data, overlayed the two geo-files and created smaller intersecting regions, for which both crime and population can be estimated.
Such intersected areas containing the relevant information can then be aggregated
to form larger area units and used to construct e.g. a Small Area or Suburb (subplace) with a particular location of interest or a city. The corresponding estimates are just the sums of
the pieces of information we used in the process. Visually intuitive process.

There are a few things to keep in mind when working with a mix of geo-spatial and numeric data:
- Inherent in this approach is an assumption that the population data is evenly distributed across the census regions. What that in essence means is that whatever region included in the census we decide to look at, there is an equal probability of people living in any part of it. Obviously, the larger the region, the less accurate such an assumption becomes as large areas can contain uninhabited stretches of land (lake, highway). Therefore, we specifically used the lowest level geo-unit for which the population data is available
-- the Small Areas (SAL). In 2013 Census data there were 84,907 SALs, which hold between 11
and 11,717 people count. As mentioned, all other populated areas are formed by
aggregation. Every SAL with its unique identifier contains a count of all people living in it, split by gender. It is those identifiers that allow us to bind the population data to a geographic area on a map.

- We are comparing geographic areas, calculate ratios, inclusions and slice things up,
and for all of it to make sense we need to make sure that:
  - all the data is in the same coordinate system, and
  - whatever system we work in, the ratio of different areas is maintained, as
   if we were performing the calculations on the surface of the Earth.

   Geographic data was released in a common geo-format, shapefiles,
developed by ESRI and describing spatial vector features. Every shapefile has spatial definition
of its coordinate system. In order to work with both police and population
boundaries and make calculations based on areas (as we do), the data needs to be referenced with respect to a planar surface by means of an equal-area projection. We use the Africa Albers Equal Area Conic (AEA).
See *notes/* for details on the SA spatial standards and projections and *scripts/* for how the data
was processed.


Hereon, we assume that the data is prepped as outlined above and we focus on a particular
type of crime.


The analysis has two steps:

1. First, we estimate the crime rate per person for each of the police precincts.
   To illustrate the line of thought, let us focus on a precinct P (the analysis is preformed for all simultaneously). We need an estimate of its total population, which can be inferred as a sum of
   population from all the intersections of P with SALs as follows:

   - find the SALs that intersect P with intersection area > 0 (no border cases)
   - for each of the intersecting SALs calculate the number of people that fall in the intersection based on the fraction of SAL's area included in P. For example, if a given SAL with 100 people living
     in it intersects P in 50%, the population of the intersection would be 0.5*100 = 50
    - sum up the populations across all intersections contained in P
    - calculate the estimate of the rate: (number of crimes in P)/(number of people in P).


2. Given the crime rate per person in P and the population data from its intersections with SALs,
   the expected number of crimes in a SAL is obtained by summing over all its partial intersections with any of the police precincts and multiplying the number of people
   in a given intersection by the crime rate of the police precinct the intersection belongs to.

To sum up, overlaying the areas of SALs and police precincts results in a set of smaller
regions, which we referred to as intersections, and for which (by making a few assumptions)
we are able to infer the expected number of crimes. Since census boundaries are hierarchical,
such intersections make up boundaries at higher levels and we can obtain the estimates
of crime statistics for regions of choice.

Analogous analysis was performed using election boundaries (wards) in place of
Small Areas. With the release of the 2016 re-mapped Ward boundaries (soon!), the data will be
incorporated into the [Wazimap] for easy and dynamic exploration.

### Data
National population data is available at various levels of granularity
from the SA 2013 Census. The crime statistics and police precinct boundaries
are available from the [open data portal] and in the *data* folder.
