# General intro for SA cartographic/geo- systems
##DATUM
There are two principal datums used in South Africa: Cape (obsolete)
and Hartebeesthoek94 (current).

The Cape datum is the older of the two is no longer used. This references
the Clarke 1880 ellipsoid and was developed by Sir Thomas Maclear and
Sir David Gill in the late 19th - early 20th Century and had its orgin
at Buffelsfontein, Port Elizabeth.
Since 01/01/1999 the official coordinate system for South Africa
is the Hartebeesthoek94 geodetic datum,
The Hartebeesthoek 1994 is based on the World Geodetic System 1984 ellipsoid,
commonly known as WGS84, with the International Terrestrial Reference Frame
1991 coordinates of the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory Telescope
(west of Johannesburg near the Cradle of Humankind) used as the origin of this system.

##PROJECTIONS
The common projections seen in South Africa use the Transverse Mercator
Projection and can bee seen in some software as "Hartebeesthoek94 Lo15"
where the "Lo15" indicates the zone name (named after the value of its origin,
similarly to UTM Zones).

In more detail:
A variation of the UTM projection that defines the national coordinate systemus
 in SA is called the “Gauss Conformal Projection” (aka form of Gauss–Krüger or transverse
Mercator, TM, EPSG projection 2047,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Mercator_projection)
This modification of the Mercator projection is used for the computation
of the plane YLo and XLo co-ordinates, commonly known as the "Lo. co-ordinate system".
The equator will project as a straight line, at right angles to the central meridian (Lo.),
but all other meridians and parallels will project as curved lines.
The principles of the projection are the same as the UTM with a difference that
each zone is only 2° wide (as opposed to 6° in the standard UM).
Only the area within one degree of longitude on either side of the central
meridian is projected. The width of each segment (belt) is thus two degrees
of longitude and is referred to the central meridian (CM) of that belt.

- X (Southings) coordinates are measured southwards from the equator,
increasing from the equator (where X = 0m) towards the South Pole.
- Y (Westings) coordinates are measured from the CM of the respective zone,
increasing from the CM (where Y=0) in a westerly direction.
Y is +ve west of the CM and -ve east of the CM.

There is less distortion and no scale factor is required.
Longitudes 17°East, 19°East, 21°East, 23°East, 25°East, 27°East, 29°East,
31°East and 33°East are used as the mid-points of each 2° projection.
These coordinate zones were Lo17, Lo19, Lo21 etc in Cape Datum
(until 1999) and are now referred to as Wg17, Wg19, Wg21 etc
(Haartebeeshoek 1994 datum).

E.g.
The coordinate zone in use in the Durban area is Wg31 because as longitude 31°
east runs directly through the city. Cape Town is Wg17-Wg18

## PROCESS:
###General things to note:
1. It is good practice to store a version of the data in the projection
in which it was captured. Re-projection can be a lossy process,
and it is important to have the original data, e.g. storing in WGS84 for the sake of
simplicity. For overlaying vector in google maps this will be enough.

2. For the calculations we need to re-project in meters (planar projection)

3. There is a number of important mutually exclusive classes of projections,
each having distinctive geometric qualities and used for different purposes:

- Conformal (or orthomorphic) projections preserve angular relationships between
great circles (=preserving shapes). They do not maintain correct areal scales.

- Equal area (or equivalent, equiareal or authalic) projections preserve areal relationships.
In other words, given any two regions A and B on the Earth and the corresponding
regions A' and B' on an equal-area map, the surface ratios A/A' and B/B' are
identical (A and B need not have the same shape; shapes A and A' will probably be different).
An equal-area projection is not necessarily equidistant; in fact, in order to preserve area,
at any point the scale distortion in a given direction must be the inverse
of the scale distortion in the orthogonal direction. For instance, along the
Equator in the conventional aspect of Mollweide's projection the horizontal
scaling factor is slightly less than 1, and slightly above 1 in the vertical direction;
the net effect is making the continents a bit too slender.

For SA an Albers Equal Area Conic projection is a possibility
(general info: wiki/Albers_projection,  specific:

###Fitting maps to purpose, analysis and tools:

- Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the data is stored in the .crs property
(use Pyepsg)
